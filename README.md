This project will use a few components:

* **Ruby and RSpec**  
  The programming language and test framework will be the same as what you've previously used.
* **The `pg` gem**  
  This library allows us to send SQL queries to the database, and retrieve the result set.
* **A class `DatabaseConnection`**  
  This class acts as a thin layer with methods to connect to PostgreSQL and send SQL queries to it.
